=====

top-down 2D game with a map like grass and water and cliffs
Populated by roaming animals
which will be your guys' animals

autonomous animals that rove around
and eat each other and get eaten
if an animal is eaten, it disappears,
and the eating animal gets slightly larger

animals' movement capacities determine how they can move around the map

ideas:
destroy environment?
keyboard-controlled PC with pokeballs and can capture animals
fights -- killing vs. eating
animal types?


## TODO

* Spawn animals at legitimate coordinates (not in water)
* Have animals move around randomly
* Prevent animals from going in the water

* Add more types of animals

* Add animal fighting. Weaknesses/strengths? Food chain? RPS?

* Need a player (need art!) who can move and do things
